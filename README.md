- 👋 Hi, I’m @BasitKhokhar, a passionate Full Stack Web Developer with over 3 years of experience in building dynamic and responsive web applications.
- 👀 I’m interested in innovative web development projects, particularly in e-commerce, event management, and digital solutions. I thrive on challenges that push the limits of my skills in HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, Express.js, and MySQL.
